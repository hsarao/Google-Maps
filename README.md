# Google-Maps
An android app that displays basic google maps interface with camera focused on your current location in the world. The app contain custom markers to my 3 favorite places in the world. These markers have custom images, title and snippet.

The app also has app bar items which allow you to change map type between normal, satellite, hybrid or terrain.

The app request for ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission at runtime and provides ability to "fly to" different locations by changing the camera view using â€‹animateCamera().
